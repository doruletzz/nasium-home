## What is the Push Pull Legs Split?

The push-pull-legs split revolutionizes your training routine by neatly dividing your workout sessions into three categories: push, pull, and legs.

- During push workouts, you'll target key upper body muscles like the chest, shoulders, and triceps, with a focus on pushing movements.
- Pull workouts are dedicated to engaging the back, biceps, and rear deltoids through pulling exercises.
- Leg days prioritize lower body development, targeting muscles such as the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves, to foster strength and symmetry.

In the realm of fitness, the PPL split offers a wealth of exercise variations and intensity levels, ensuring a diverse and comprehensive workout regimen that effectively targets various muscle groups.

## Notes
When determining the number of sets, prioritize your working weight sets over warm-up sets. Before reaching your working weight, incorporate warm-up sets for the main lifts. Begin with low reps for warm-up sets and gradually increase the weight until you reach your working weight.

For unilateral exercises, such as lunges, ensure to count the reps for each side separately (e.g., 3 sets x 12-20 reps each side).

Schedule a deload week every 6-12 weeks (refer to deload info below for further guidance).

Feel free to vary accessory exercises according to your preference, especially if certain exercises yield diminishing returns.

For progression, focus on increasing the weight load as the most effective method (refer to progression info below).

Consider implementing supersets to enhance your workouts, particularly for certain exercises on upper body days.

Adjust rest times based on the rep range and load (refer to the rest time section above for recommendations). Rest times will vary accordingly.

## Conclusion

For those with busy schedules who can't commit to more than four gym sessions per week, the push-pull-legs split offers an ideal solution. It allows for up to four weekly sessions, provides ample volume, and ensures each muscle group is trained twice per week.

Combined with a balanced nutrition plan, adequate rest, consistency, and dedication, the push-pull-legs split can pave the way for remarkable results in just a matter of months.

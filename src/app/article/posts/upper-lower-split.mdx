## Notes
When determining the number of sets, focus on your working weight sets rather than warm-up sets. Before reaching your working weight, it's essential to do some warm-up sets for the main lifts. Start with low reps for warm-up sets and gradually increase the weight until you reach your working weight.

For exercises that target one side or are unilateral, such as lunges, make sure to count the reps for each side separately (e.g., 3 sets x 12-20 reps each side).

Schedule a deload week every 6-12 weeks (check out deload info below for more details).

Feel free to mix up accessory exercises according to your preference, especially if you notice diminishing returns with certain exercises.

When it comes to progression, increasing the weight load is the most effective method (see progression info below).

Consider incorporating supersets to optimize your workouts, particularly for some exercises on upper body days.

Rest times should be adjusted based on the rep range and load (refer to the rest time section above for guidance). Rest times will vary accordingly.

## Conclusion

If you’re busier and can’t make it to the gym more than four times per week, the upper/lower split might be your best bet. It allows you to train no more than four times per week, do enough volume, and still train all of your muscles twice per week. 

Combined with a solid nutritional plan, plenty of sleep, consistency, and effort, the upper/lower split can help you achieve fantastic results in mere months
